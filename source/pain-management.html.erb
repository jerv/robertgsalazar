			<h5>An Introduction by John J. Bonica, M.D., D.Sc. on the Historical Perspectives of Pain:</h5>
			<p class="u-quote">
				Pain has been a major concern of humankind since its beginning and the subject of ubiquitous efforts to understand and control it. It is likely that the relief of pain was the primary reason for the advent of the Shaman, healer, and later the physician and even today it remains one of the most important raisons d’être of all health professionals. Although symptomatic pain has the important biological function of indicating to the patient that something is wrong and often prompts him or her to seek medical counsel, certain types of acute pain and all forms of chronic pain are deleterious to the organism.
